    <h2>An aspect of the universe we take for granted is that it's three dimensional —<br>
        there are three perpendicular directions you can move in. Some theories,<br>
        however, suggest another spatial dimension — which we can't perceive directly<br>
        — in another perpendicular direction. This higher dimensional space is referred <br>
        to as "the bulk," while our universe is a three-dimensional membrane — or <br>
        "brane" — floating inside the bulk.<br>

        As complicated as it sounds, the braneworld picture solves several problems in <br>
        physics. For example, theoretical physicists Lisa Randall, of Harvard University, <br>
        and Raman Sundrum, of the University of Maryland, proposed a version of the <br>
        braneworld that explains an asymmetry in subatomic forces by suggesting the <br>
        existence of other branes parallel to our own. But it's not enough for a theory to <br>
        explain facts we already know — it has to make new predictions that can be <br>
        tested experimentally. In the case of the Randall-Sundrum model, such tests <br>
        could involve measuring gravitational waves emitted by black holes linking one <br>
        brane to another.</h2>
