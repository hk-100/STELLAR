    <h2 class="popup">The Big Bang, a cosmic explosion approximately 13.8 billion years ago
        <br>, birthed our universe.Unlocking its secrets involves delving into the<br> fundamental nature of space,time, and matter.
         Scientists explore cosmic<br> microwave background radiation, particle physics, and astronomical <br>
         observations to decipher the origins and evolution of the cosmos, piecing together <br>the puzzle
          of our existence.</h2>

    <h1 class="slidein">What is big bang</h1>
    <h2>The Big Bang theory is a scientific explanation for the origin of the universe.<br> It suggests that around 13.8 billion years ago, 
        the entire cosmos began as an<br> extremely hot and dense singularity. This singularity then 
        rapidly expanded,<br> initiating the creation of space and time. As the universe expanded
        it cooled,<br> allowing for the formation of fundamental elements like hydrogen and helium.<br> 
        The afterglow of this explosive event, known as the Cosmic Microwave<br> Background (CMB), 
        serves as crucial evidence supporting the Big Bang theory.<br> Over billions of years, this 
        initial burst of energy and matter led to the formation of<br> galaxies, stars, and planets,
         giving rise to the diverse and awe-inspiring universe we observe today.

    <h1>The cosmic Symphony</h1>
    <h2> "The Cosmic Symphony is a metaphorical description of the orchestrated interplay of fundamental forces, particles, and energies during and after the Big Bang. Picture the universe's early moments as the opening notes, a high-energy ensemble where particles and forces interacted intensely. As the symphony progressed, the universe expanded and cooled, allowing the emergence of harmonies like gravity and electromagnetism. The formation of atoms and galaxies adds unique motifs to the composition, while the Cosmic Microwave Background serves as a faint echo from the symphony's inception. This metaphor highlights the interconnected elegance of the cosmos, where each cosmic entity contributes to an ongoing, awe-inspiring cosmic performance."</h2>
