    <h1>Plasma-filled cosmos</h1>
    <h2>The Big Bang remains the preferred theory of many scientists, supported by two <br>
        key observations â€” the expansion of the universe and the cosmic microwave <br>
        background (CMB). Immediately after the Big Bang, the universe was much <br>
        smaller and hotter, filled with a glowing plasma like the sun. We still see the end <br>
        of this super-hot phase in the form of a sea of radiation filling the whole of <br>
        space. The expansion of the universe over the intervening billions of years has <br>
        cooled the radiation down to minus 454 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 270 degrees <br>
        Celsius), but it is still detectable by radio telescopes.<br>

        The CMB looks virtually the same in every direction, which can't be explained if <br>
        the universe has always expanded at its current rate. Many scientists believe it <br>
        went through a brief period of extremely rapid "inflation" a fraction of a second <br>
        after the Big Bang, suddenly ballooning in size from a subatomic scale to several <br>
        light-years.</h2>
